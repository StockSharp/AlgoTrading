# Designer Strategies Examples Directory

Welcome to the [Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/strategy-designer/) Strategies Examples Directory. This folder contains a collection of trading strategy examples specifically designed for use with the Designer program, a visual and code-based environment within the StockSharp platform. These examples are provided in both schematic and C# code formats to cater to different styles of development and learning.

## Directory Structure

This directory is organized to help you easily find and utilize various trading strategy examples:

- **Schematic Examples**: Contains strategy examples created using the [visual design features](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/strategies/using_visual_designer.html) of Designer. These are primarily `.json` files that can be directly imported into Designer.
- **C# Code Examples**: Includes strategy examples [written in C#](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/strategies/using_csharp.html) that demonstrate how to programmatically define trading logic within Designer.

## Purpose of the Examples

The primary goals of providing these examples are:

- **Educational Tool**: To help new and existing users of the [Designer](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer.html) program learn through practical examples.
- **Inspiration for Development**: To inspire users to develop and customize their own strategies by demonstrating various techniques and approaches.
- **Community Engagement**: To encourage users to share their own examples and improvements, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment.

## How to Use These Examples

To make the most out of these examples, follow these steps:

1. **Choose an Example**: Browse the directory and select an example that aligns with your trading interests or learning needs.
2. **Download and Import**: For schematic examples, download the `.json` file and [import](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/export_import/import.html) it into your Designer program. For C# examples, copy the code or download the file to your project.
3. **Study and Modify**: Examine how the strategies are constructed and consider modifying them to better fit your specific trading criteria or to experiment with new ideas.
4. **Test and Deploy**: Always [test your strategies](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/backtesting/getting_started.html) in a simulated environment provided by Designer before applying them in [live trading](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/live_execution/getting_started.html) to ensure they perform as expected.
