# Strategy Example with Mathematical Formulas and Expressions

This file contains a detailed example of a trading strategy designed using the Designer platform from StockSharp. The strategy integrates mathematical expressions and formulas to execute trades based on specific conditions met by technical indicators.

## Strategy Overview

This schema demonstrates the application of two popular technical indicators to make trading decisions:

### Bollinger Bands Strategy
- **Buy Condition**: A buy order is triggered when the price candle crosses above the upper curve of the Bollinger Bands indicator.
- **Sell Condition**: A sell order is executed when the price candle crosses below the lower curve of the Bollinger Bands indicator.

### MACD Indicator Strategy
- **Buy Condition**: Initiates a buy order when the MACD curve changes its sign from negative to positive.
- **Sell Condition**: Triggers a sell order when the MACD curve changes its sign from positive to negative.

## Additional Features

- **Visual Comparison**: The schema allows for a side-by-side visual comparison of the outcomes from both strategies.
- **Results Exporting**: It includes functionality to export the test results into a file for further analysis.

This schema provides a practical framework for understanding and applying mathematical tools in trading strategies, leveraging the capabilities of the Designer platform.
