# Simple Strategy Schema for Designer

This document accompanies a schematic file that outlines a simple trading strategy using the Designer tool from StockSharp. The schema provides a visual representation of the strategy's workflow and components, allowing users to understand and replicate its functionality within their own trading environment.

## Strategy Overview

The simple strategy demonstrated in this schema focuses on basic trading signals based on predefined criteria such as moving averages, price thresholds, or volume indicators. The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of how to construct and execute a strategy within the Designer framework.

## Schema Components

The schema includes the following key components:

- **Data Sources**: Defines the market data inputs used by the strategy, including price and volume data.
- **Indicators**: Utilizes common technical indicators that trigger trading signals when certain conditions are met.
- **Decision Nodes**: Shows the logic paths that determine when and how trades are executed based on the data and indicators.
- **Execution Commands**: Details the actions taken when a trade signal is confirmed, such as buy or sell orders.

## Using the Schema

To use this schema effectively:

1. **Open the File in Designer**: Load the schematic file into the Designer tool to view and modify the strategy.
2. **Study the Workflow**: Understand how each component interacts and how data flows through the strategy.
3. **Customize the Strategy**: Make adjustments to the strategy components to suit your specific trading preferences and risk management criteria.
4. **Simulate and Deploy**: Test the strategy using historical data simulation features in Designer and adjust based on the outcomes before going live.

This schema serves as an educational tool for those new to trading automation and strategy design using the Designer software. It provides a practical example of how a simple strategy can be visually mapped out and executed within a powerful trading platform.
