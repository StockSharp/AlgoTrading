# Custom Code Cube Schema

This schema provides an overview of using and creating custom code cubes within the Designer platform, focusing on the "Source Code" cube. It guides users through the process of crafting unique, code-based cubes tailored for specific trading strategies or analytical tasks.

## Overview

The "Source Code" cube is a powerful feature in Designer that allows users to input custom C# code directly into their trading schemes. This capability enables the incorporation of complex logic that goes beyond standard trading indicators and operations.

## Key Components

- **Source Code Cube**: A cube within Designer where users can directly enter and edit C# code.
- **Custom Code Creation**: The process of developing bespoke functionality within a cube using C# programming language.

## Creating a Custom Code Cube

- **Accessing the Source Code Cube**: Navigate to the appropriate section within the Designer interface where cubes are listed and select the "Source Code" cube.
- **Entering Code**: Input the C# code directly into the cube's coding interface. This code can define specific trading conditions, calculate custom indicators, or even handle data in unique ways.
- **Integration**: Once the code is entered and configured, the cube can be integrated into larger trading strategies within the Designer environment.

## Custom Cube Creation

- **Designing Unique Logic**: Users can create a cube that performs operations tailored to their specific trading strategy needs. This might include complex mathematical models or decision-making algorithms.
- **Implementation**: Implement the logic by writing C# code in the cube's development environment. This includes defining inputs, outputs, and processing logic.

## Advantages of Custom Code Cubes

- **Flexibility**: Provides the ability to implement trading ideas that are not possible with standard cubes available in Designer.
- **Precision**: Allows for precise control over trading logic and decision-making processes.
- **Optimization**: Traders can fine-tune their strategies by adjusting the code, which can lead to improved trading performance.

## Practical Application

- **Algorithm Enhancement**: Traders can use custom code cubes to enhance existing algorithms, providing additional functionality or improving on the logic.
- **Strategy Testing**: Custom cubes can be used in backtesting environments to test how the coded strategies perform under historical data.
- **Real-time Execution**: Once tested, these cubes can be employed in real-time trading scenarios, executing complex strategies that adapt to market conditions.

The schema detailed here is an essential guide for traders looking to leverage the full potential of the Designer's programming capabilities, enabling the creation of highly customized and potentially more effective trading strategies.
