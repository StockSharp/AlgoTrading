## Strategy Overview

The strategy incorporates two moving averages:

- **Short-term Moving Average**: A faster moving average that reacts more quickly to price changes.
- **Long-term Moving Average**: A slower moving average that provides a smoother picture of price trends.

## Entry and Exit Rules

- **Buy Signal**: The strategy generates a buy signal when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, suggesting an upward trend.
- **Sell Signal**: Conversely, a sell signal is issued when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downward trend.

## Diagram Details

The diagram visually presents the logic flow of the strategy:

- **Moving Averages Calculation**: Nodes calculate the moving averages based on user-defined parameters such as the period and type of moving average (e.g., simple, exponential).
- **Comparison Nodes**: Evaluate the crossover conditions to determine whether to enter or exit positions.
- **Trading Actions**: Nodes that execute buy or sell orders based on the evaluation results from the comparison nodes.
