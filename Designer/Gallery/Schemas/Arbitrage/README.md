# Pair Trading Strategy on BTC and ETH

## Overview

The strategy implements mechanisms for buying one cryptocurrency while simultaneously selling another, aiming to profit from temporary discrepancies in their values. This makes the strategy appealing for those looking for earning opportunities from minimal market fluctuations without being tied to the general market trend.
