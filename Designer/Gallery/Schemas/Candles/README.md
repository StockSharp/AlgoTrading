## Overview

The diagram showcases the basic setup required to retrieve candle data for a specific financial instrument and display it on a chart. This serves as a foundational example for those new to using Designer or those who wish to start with simple data visualization techniques.

## Components of the Diagram

- **Candles Data Source**: This is the primary node that fetches candle data from the selected financial instrument. Users can specify the instrument, the data range, and the candle time frame (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute candles).

- **Chart Cube**: This node is used to plot the fetched data on a graphical interface. It can display various candle attributes such as open, high, low, and close prices.

## Functionality

- **Data Retrieval**: The diagram starts by retrieving candle data using the specified parameters in the Candles Data Source cube.
- **Data Visualization**: The retrieved data is then passed to the Chart cube, which plots the candles on a chart within the Designer environment.

## Use Case

This diagram is particularly useful for:
- New users learning how to set up data retrieval and visualization in Designer.
- Traders and analysts looking to quickly visualize market data for analysis.
- Educational purposes, demonstrating the basic interaction between data source nodes and visualization tools within the platform.

## Practical Application

By understanding and using this basic setup, users can:
- Quickly set up visual representations of market data for real-time or historical analysis.
- Extend the basic diagram by incorporating additional analytical tools or indicators available within the Designer.
- Use the chart as a building block for more complex trading strategies or data studies.

This diagram is part of a broader set of educational resources available in the Designer platform, aimed at enhancing users' proficiency in data handling and visualization.
