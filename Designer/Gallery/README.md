# Strategy Source Code Directory

This directory contains the source codes of trading strategies available in the "Strategy Gallery" section of the [Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/strategy-designer/) platform. The strategies are presented in both schematic form and C# code, providing users with a range of customizable trading solutions.

## Overview

The Strategy Gallery in [Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/strategy-designer/) offers a diverse collection of trading strategies developed by the community and StockSharp experts. This directory serves as a repository for the source codes of these strategies, enabling users to explore, modify, and potentially enhance the strategies according to their trading needs.

## Contents

- **Schematic Strategies**: Diagrammatic representations of trading strategies that visually depict the flow and conditions of trading operations. These are ideal for users who prefer a visual approach to strategy design.
- **C# Code Strategies**: Source code files written in C#, offering a deeper level of customization and control. These files cater to users who are comfortable with programming and wish to implement complex logic or algorithms directly.

## Usage

Users can download these strategies to study the underlying logic, test them in simulation environments, or deploy them in live trading scenarios. Each strategy can be imported into the Designer platform where it can be further customized or used as a base for new strategy development.

## Contributing

While this directory primarily hosts strategies developed for the Designer platform, contributions from the community are welcome. Users who have developed their own strategies and wish to share them with the StockSharp community can submit their schematic or code files for inclusion in the gallery.

## Educational Value

- **Learning Tool**: New traders or developers can learn from the structured setup and coding practices used in these strategies.
- **Innovation Base**: Experienced users can use these strategies as a base to innovate or create more complex algorithms that cater to specific market conditions.

This directory not only serves as a resource for trading strategies but also as a community hub for sharing knowledge and fostering innovation within the field of algorithmic trading.
