# Strategy Source Code Directory

This directory contains schematic representations of trading strategies available in the [Strategy Gallery](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/strategy_gallery.html) section of the [Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/strategy-designer/) platform. Strategy source code files are stored in the [API](../../API) directory, where they can be loaded as standalone programs through the StockSharp API or imported into Designer.

## Overview

The Strategy Gallery in [Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/strategy-designer/) offers a diverse collection of trading strategies developed by the community and StockSharp experts. This directory serves as a repository for schematic versions of these strategies, enabling users to explore, modify, and potentially enhance them according to their trading needs. Source code implementations are available in the [API](../../API) directory.

## Contents

- **Schematic Strategies**: Diagrammatic representations of trading strategies that [visually depict](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/strategies/using_visual_designer.html) the flow and conditions of trading operations. These are ideal for users who prefer a visual approach to strategy design.
- **C# Code Strategies**: Strategy source code files are located in the [API](../../API) directory. They can be loaded as standalone programs via the StockSharp API or imported into Designer for further customization.

## Usage

Users can download these strategies to study the underlying logic, [test](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer/backtesting/getting_started.html) them in simulation environments, or deploy them in live trading scenarios. Each strategy can be imported into the Designer platform where it can be further customized or used as a base for new strategy development.

## Contributing

While this directory primarily hosts strategies developed for the Designer platform, contributions from the community are welcome. Users who have developed their own strategies and wish to share them with the StockSharp community can submit their schematic files for inclusion here, while source code contributions should be added to the [API](../../API) directory.

## Educational Value

- **Learning Tool**: New traders or developers can learn from the structured setup and coding practices used in these strategies.
- **Innovation Base**: Experienced users can use these strategies as a base to innovate or create more complex algorithms that cater to specific market conditions.

This directory not only serves as a resource for trading strategies but also as a community hub for sharing knowledge and fostering innovation within the field of algorithmic trading.
