# StockSharp Algorithmic Trading and Strategy Designer Repository

Welcome to the official repository for algorithmic trading strategies and the [Strategy Designer](https://doc.stocksharp.com/topics/designer.html) designed for the StockSharp platform. This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for both new and experienced traders and developers using StockSharp for automated trading and strategy design.

## Repository Purpose

This repository provides detailed examples and source code for various algorithmic trading strategies and features from the Strategy Designer that can be implemented on the StockSharp platform. The primary goals are:

- **Educational Resource**: Enhance learning and understanding of algorithmic trading and the StockSharp Strategy Designer through practical examples.
- **Community Collaboration**: Encourage the community to contribute their own strategies, enhancements, and insights, sharing knowledge and best practices for trading automation.
- **Showcase Capabilities**: Demonstrate the versatility and power of the StockSharp platform in developing, testing, and optimizing trading strategies and algorithmic solutions.

## Strategy Source Code

All strategy implementations in source code form are located in the `API` directory. These files can be loaded as standalone programs through the StockSharp API or opened directly in Designer.
