This strategy enters long when the fast EMA crosses above the slow EMA and the difference between them exceeds an ATR-based threshold. It enters short on the opposite signal. Positions are exited when price moves an ATR multiple against the trade or reaches a profit target of two ATR multiples. A cooldown period limits trade frequency.
