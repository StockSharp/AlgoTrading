# MomentumSync PSAR RSI ADX Filtered 3-Tier Exit

This strategy uses the Parabolic SAR to detect early trend reversals and requires both RSI and ADX to exceed configurable thresholds before entering a long position. After a bearish PSAR flip, the trade is closed on the third bar, implementing a three-step exit sequence.
