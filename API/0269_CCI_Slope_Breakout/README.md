# CCI Slope Breakout
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The CCI Slope Breakout strategy monitors the rate of change of the CCI. An unusually steep slope hints that a new trend is forming.

Entries occur when slope exceeds its typical level by a multiple of standard deviation, taking trades in the direction of acceleration with a protective stop.

It appeals to active traders eager for early trend exposure. Positions exit when the slope drifts back toward normal readings. Default `CciPeriod` = 20.
