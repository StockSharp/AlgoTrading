# SimpleRulesUntil Strategy Explanation

## Overview

This strategy subscribes to market depth updates and executes a logging rule each time a new depth message is received. The rule logs the best bid and ask prices along with a counter which is incremented with each execution. The rule continues to execute until a predefined condition is met—in this case, until the rule has been executed ten times.

## Strategy Initialization

### OnStarted Method
When the strategy is initiated, it sets up subscriptions for trade ticks and market depth, then defines a rule to handle updates in market depth:

```csharp
protected override void OnStarted(DateTimeOffset time)
{
    var tickSub = this.SubscribeTrades(Security); // Subscribe to trades, not used in the current setup.
    var mdSub = this.SubscribeMarketDepth(Security); // Subscribe to market depth updates.

    var i = 0;
    mdSub.WhenOrderBookReceived(this).Do(depth =>
    {
        i++;
        this.AddInfoLog($"The rule WhenOrderBookReceived BestBid={depth.GetBestBid()}, BestAsk={depth.GetBestAsk()}");
        this.AddInfoLog($"The rule WhenOrderBookReceived i={i}");
    })
	.Until(() => i >= 10) // Continue executing until the counter reaches 10.
    .Apply(this);
	
    base.OnStarted(time);
}
```

### Key Functionalities

- **Market Depth Subscription**: The strategy subscribes to market depth updates for the specified security. This provides real-time data about the best available bid and ask prices in the order book.
- **Logging Rule**: It logs details about the market depth each time an update is received. This includes logging the current state of the best bid and ask, as well as the number of times the rule has been triggered.
- **Conditional Rule Termination**: The `.Until()` method is used to specify a condition under which the rule should stop executing. This condition checks if the counter `i` has reached 10, limiting the rule's activity to ten executions.

## Usage and Implications

This strategy showcases a simple but powerful feature of StockSharp's rule-based system, demonstrating how to limit the number of times a rule executes based on market data updates. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where:
- **Resource Management**: Limiting rule execution can help manage resource use, especially in high-frequency trading environments.
- **Event-Driven Decisions**: Traders can use this pattern to make decisions after observing a certain number of events, such as adjusting strategy parameters after sufficient market data has been analyzed.
- **Testing and Debugging**: In testing scenarios, limiting the number of executions can help in isolating and debugging specific behaviors of the strategy.

## Conclusion

The `SimpleRulesUntil` strategy provides a clear example of how to implement and control the execution of trading rules using conditional logic in StockSharp. This approach enhances the flexibility and efficiency of trading strategies, allowing them to operate within predefined operational boundaries, which is crucial for maintaining performance and reliability in automated trading systems.
