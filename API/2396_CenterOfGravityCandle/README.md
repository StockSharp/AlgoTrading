# Center Of Gravity Candle Strategy

This strategy trades synthetic candles generated by the Center of Gravity Candle indicator. The indicator applies John Ehlers' Center of Gravity algorithm separately to open, high, low and close prices and forms virtual candles. The color of the virtual candle is used as a trading signal.

## Trading Rules

1. The indicator is calculated on every finished candle of the selected timeframe.
2. When the indicator value crosses above the zero line the strategy enters a long position and closes any short.
3. When the value crosses below zero the strategy enters a short position and closes any long.

## Parameters

- **Period** – main period of the indicator.
- **Smooth Period** – smoothing period applied to the indicator output.
- **Signal Bar** – bar shift used to evaluate the signal (1 = previous finished bar).
- **Candle Type** – timeframe of candles used for calculation.

The strategy uses the high level StockSharp API. Stop-loss and take-profit management are not implemented; the position is simply reversed on every signal.
