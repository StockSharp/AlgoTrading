# Chart Browser Strategy

## Overview
The Chart Browser strategy reproduces the MetaTrader utility by monitoring chart-related information for a single security and presenting it as textual summaries inside StockSharp. It simultaneously observes two candle streams, calculates a sample simple moving average, tracks the strategy's own trading activity, and periodically prints a consolidated report. The active tab parameter emulates the original script's tab selector by highlighting the corresponding section when new data arrives.

## Behaviour
- Subscribes to the timeframe defined by **Chart Candle Type** and logs the most recent finished candle when the "Charts" tab is active.
- Subscribes to the timeframe defined by **Indicator Candle Type**, applies an **SMA** with the configured **Indicator Length**, and logs the latest value for the "Indicators" tab.
- Counts registered orders, active orders, executed trades, and the current position for the "Experts" tab.
- Uses the summary timer to mimic the "Scripts" tab, reporting the last time a full refresh was produced together with the timer configuration.
- Generates a consolidated summary at the configured interval and whenever the active tab changes while the strategy is running.

## Parameters
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Chart Candle Type | Timeframe used for the chart tab candle stream. |
| Indicator Candle Type | Timeframe used for the SMA calculation shown on the indicators tab. |
| Indicator Length | Period of the SMA indicator. |
| Active Tab | Determines which section is highlighted when new data arrives. |
| Summary Interval | Period between automatic summary reports; set to zero to disable the timer. |
| Auto Log Latest Values | When enabled, logs the active tab description whenever new information arrives for that tab. |

## Usage
1. Assign the target security and, if needed, adjust the candle types or SMA length to match the chart layout you want to monitor.
2. Choose the default **Active Tab** to mirror the tab that should react to incoming data.
3. Configure **Summary Interval** to control how often complete status reports are emitted (set to `00:00:00` to disable periodic summaries).
4. Start the strategy. Candle updates, indicator values, and trading activity will be written to the log, providing a quick overview similar to the original Chart Browser dialog.

## Notes
- The strategy does not send orders automatically; it only tracks orders that are manually placed or generated by other logic within the same strategy instance.
- Switching the **Active Tab** while the strategy is running immediately prints the description for the newly selected tab.
- Ensure real-time or historical candle data is available for the selected timeframes to populate the chart and indicator tabs.
