# Footprint strategy

This strategy analyses the imbalance between buy and sell volumes inside each bar (footprint). A long position is opened when buy volume exceeds sell volume by a configurable percentage and the candle closes below its open. An optional daily trend filter is available. Profit target and stop loss are managed through built-in protection.
