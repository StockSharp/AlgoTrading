# RSI, Volume, MACD, EMA Combo Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

Combines MACD and RSI signals with EMA trend and volume confirmation. Long entries require MACD above its signal, RSI above the overbought level, price above EMA and volume greater than its SMA. Shorts use the opposite logic. Positions close when RSI crosses the 50 line.
