# StockSharp Strategies

This directory contains a collection of trading strategies developed using the **StockSharp API**. StockSharp is a powerful open-source library designed for creating trading applications, providing tools for market data processing, order execution, and strategy implementation.

## Overview

The strategies in this directory are written in [insert programming language, e.g., C#] and leverage the StockSharp API to interact with financial markets. Each strategy is designed to demonstrate different approaches to automated trading, such as trend-following, mean reversion, or arbitrage, depending on the specific implementation.

## Compatibility

These strategies are compatible with all StockSharp products:
- **[StockSharp API](https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp)**: The open-source library for building custom trading applications.
- **[Designer](https://stocksharp.com/store/designer/)**: A visual tool for creating and testing trading strategies without coding.
- **[Shell](https://stocksharp.com/store/shell/)**: A lightweight application for managing and executing trading strategies.
- **[Runner](https://stocksharp.com/store/runner/)**: A high-performance tool for running multiple strategies simultaneously.

This ensures flexibility whether you're coding directly with the API or using StockSharp's graphical or execution tools.

## Purpose

The purpose of this collection is to:
- Showcase practical examples of using the StockSharp API.
- Provide a starting point for developers and traders interested in building their own automated trading systems.
- Illustrate how to integrate market data, indicators, and order management within a strategy.

## Getting Started

To use these strategies, ensure you have the following:
1. One or more StockSharp products installed (see links above).
2. Access to a compatible trading platform or data provider supported by StockSharp.
3. Basic knowledge of the programming language used in the strategies (if working with the API directly).

Each strategy file should include comments or documentation explaining its logic, parameters, and usage.
