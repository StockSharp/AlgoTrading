## Important Note

Please note that the examples provided in this folder are not compatible with the Designer platform. They are intended for direct use and modification within C# projects and require a solid understanding of programming concepts and the .NET. Additionally, some examples may require adding a connector from StockSharp's private NuGet server. For more information on accessing and using this server, please visit [StockSharp's NuGet server manual](https://stocksharp.com/products/nuget_manual/#privateserver).

By exploring and utilizing these examples, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how to implement robust trading solutions using the StockSharp API, paving the way for the development of sophisticated trading robots and analytical tools.
