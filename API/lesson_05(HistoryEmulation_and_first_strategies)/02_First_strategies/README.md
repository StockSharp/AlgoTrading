The provided example in your `MainWindow` class demonstrates how to set up a WPF application using the StockSharp library to test different trading strategies on historical market data. The example is versatile, allowing the user to test various predefined strategies by simply uncommenting the desired strategy in the code. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the application operates and integrates these strategies with the historical data testing framework:

---

# Strategy Testing on Historical Data using StockSharp

## Overview

The application is designed to facilitate the backtesting of multiple trading strategies by replaying historical market data through a `HistoryEmulationConnector`. This setup allows for evaluating the performance of strategies such as `OneCandleCountertrend`, `OneCandleTrend`, `StairsCountertrend`, and `StairsTrend` under historically accurate market conditions.

## Key Components of the Application

### Initialization and Configuration

Upon launching the application, the UI components are initialized, and logging listeners are set up to capture and display relevant information:

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
	InitializeComponent();
	_logManager = new LogManager();
	_logManager.Listeners.Add(new FileLogListener("log.txt"));
	_logManager.Listeners.Add(new GuiLogListener(Monitor));
	DatePickerBegin.SelectedDate = Paths.HistoryBeginDate;
	DatePickerEnd.SelectedDate = Paths.HistoryEndDate;
	CandleSettingsEditor.DataType = DataType.TimeFrame(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
}
```

- **LogManager**: Captures logs for debugging and analysis.
- **Date Pickers**: Allows the user to select the period for historical data simulation.
- **Candle Settings**: Configures the candle data type used during the simulation.

### Strategy Setup and Historical Data Simulation

When the user starts the simulation, the application configures the necessary components for running the selected trading strategy on historical data:

```csharp
private void Start_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
	// Setup security, portfolio, and storage for historical data
	_security = new Security { Id = "SBER@TQBR", Code = "SBER", PriceStep = 0.01m, Board = ExchangeBoard.Micex };
	_portfolio = new Portfolio { Name = "test account", BeginValue = 1000000 };
	var storageRegistry = new StorageRegistry { DefaultDrive = new LocalMarketDataDrive(_pathHistory) };

	// Initialize the history emulation connector
	_connector = new HistoryEmulationConnector(new[] { _security }, new[] { _portfolio }) { ... };
	_logManager.Sources.Add(_connector);

	//
	// !!! IMPORTANT !!!
	// Uncomment the desired strategy
	//
	_strategy = new OneCandleCountertrendStrategy(_candleSeries);
	//_strategy = new OneCandleTrendStrategy(_candleSeries);
	//_strategy = new StairsCountertrendStrategy(_candleSeries);
	//_strategy = new StairsTrendStrategy(_candleSeries);

	_logManager.Sources.Add(_strategy);
	_connector.Connected += Connector_Connected;
	_connector.Connect();
}
```

### Chart and Strategy Output Visualization

The application includes a charting setup to visualize the trading outcomes and other relevant financial indicators such as P&L, trades, and commissions:

```csharp
private void InitChart()
{
	// Setup chart areas and elements for visualization
	Chart.ClearAreas();
	var area = new ChartArea();
	_candleElement = new ChartCandleElement();
	_tradesElem = new ChartTradeElement { FullTitle = "Trade" };
	Chart.AddArea(area);
	Chart.AddElement(area, _candleElement);
	Chart.AddElement(area, _tradesElem);
	...
}
```

### Event Handling and Strategy Execution

Once connected, the strategy starts alongside the market data simulation, allowing for real-time monitoring and analysis of strategy performance:

```csharp
private void Connector_Connected()
{
	_strategy.Start();
	_connector.Start();
}
```

## Conclusion

This application provides a comprehensive environment for developing, testing, and analyzing trading strategies using historical market data. It demonstrates the capability of the StockSharp library to integrate with a WPF application, providing tools for extensive financial analysis and strategy development. By allowing users to easily switch between different strategies, the application serves as a valuable tool for both novice and experienced traders looking to optimize their trading algorithms based on historical performance.
