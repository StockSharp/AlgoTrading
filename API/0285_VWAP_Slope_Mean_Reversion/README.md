# VWAP Slope Mean Reversion
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The VWAP Slope Mean Reversion strategy focuses on extreme readings of the VWAP to exploit reversion. Wide departures from the normal level rarely last.

Trades trigger when the indicator swings far from its mean and then begins to reverse. Both long and short setups include a protective stop.

Suited for swing traders expecting oscillations, the strategy closes out once the VWAP returns toward balance. Starting parameter `SlopeLookback` = 20.
