# Oscillator Evaluator Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

This strategy combines the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator to identify entry and exit points. A long position is opened when both oscillators fall below the oversold threshold, while a short position is opened when both rise above the overbought threshold. Positions are closed once both indicators return to the neutral zone. The strategy also supports configurable take-profit and stop-loss protection.
