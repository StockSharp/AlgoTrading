Demonstrates computing a color gradient from red to green based on RSI and trades when RSI crosses the center line.

## Logic
- Calculates a Relative Strength Index with configurable period.
- Derives a gradient color for visualization.
- Buys when RSI moves above 50.
- Sells when RSI moves below 50.
