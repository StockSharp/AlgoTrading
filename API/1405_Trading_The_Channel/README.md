# Trading The Channel Strategy

This strategy uses a linear regression channel to generate signals.

Three trade rules are supported:

1. Trade the trend – enter on slope changes.
2. Trade channel breakouts – enter on breaks above or below the channel.
3. Trade within the channel – fade moves inside the channel with an optional trend filter.

Parameters include period, zone percent, range source, trade rule, trend filter and a long-only option.
