# Genie Pivot Fixed Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

This strategy implements the "Genie" pivot point reversal scalping system originally written in MQL4. It scans the last eight candles to detect sudden reversals at pivot points. A long trade is triggered when seven consecutive lows decrease and the current candle makes a higher low while closing above the previous high. A short trade is triggered when seven consecutive highs increase and the current candle makes a lower high while closing below the previous low.

The strategy uses a fixed position size (Strategy.Volume) and applies both a trailing stop and a take-profit measured in absolute price units. These parameters can be optimized and allow the method to capture quick reversals while protecting open profits.
