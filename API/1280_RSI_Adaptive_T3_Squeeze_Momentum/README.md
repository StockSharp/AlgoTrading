# RSI-Adaptive T3 + Squeeze Momentum Strategy

Combines an RSI-adaptive Tillson T3 trend filter with the Squeeze Momentum technique. The T3 length adjusts between the minimum and maximum values based on RSI. A long position opens when the adaptive T3 turns up during a squeeze release with positive momentum. Short entries occur when the T3 turns down with negative momentum after the squeeze ends.
