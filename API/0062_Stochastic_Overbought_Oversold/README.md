# Stochastic Overbought/Oversold Reversal
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The strategy reacts to extreme levels of the Stochastic Oscillator. When the %K line dives into oversold territory the system expects a bounce, whereas overbought readings can foreshadow a drop. The method runs on short intraday candles so signals arrive quickly.

After subscribing to the selected timeframe it monitors the %K and %D lines. A bullish setup forms when %K falls below 20 and then begins to recover. Conversely, a bearish setup appears if %K rallies above 80 and starts to turn down. A fixed percent stop controls risk for either side.

Positions are exited when the %K line crosses back through the 50 level, signaling momentum has shifted toward the opposite direction. Because stops scale with the latest ATR, the trade size adapts to volatility.
