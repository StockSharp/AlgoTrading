# Anchored Momentum Breakout Strategy

## Overview
The Anchored Momentum Breakout Strategy uses the ratio of an exponential moving average (EMA) to a simple moving average (SMA) to measure momentum. When the short-term EMA begins to rise faster than the long-term SMA, it indicates increasing bullish momentum. Conversely, a falling ratio signals strengthening bearish momentum.

## How It Works
1. **Indicators**
   - EMA with configurable period.
   - SMA with configurable period.
2. **Momentum Calculation**
   - `Momentum = 100 * (EMA / SMA - 1)`
   - Positive momentum means EMA is above SMA; negative momentum means EMA is below SMA.
3. **Trading Logic**
   - If momentum has been decreasing and then turns upward, the strategy enters a long position.
   - If momentum has been increasing and then turns downward, the strategy enters a short position.
   - Position size automatically includes the existing position to reverse when needed.
4. **Risk Management**
   - Stop-loss and take-profit levels are set as percentages of entry price using the built-in protection mechanism.
