# Genie Pivot Strategy

This strategy implements the **Genie Pivot** reversal scalping idea originally written in MQL4. It waits for a pivot pattern formed by seven consecutive candles and manages the open position with a fixed take profit and trailing stop.

## Strategy Logic

1. **Pattern detection** – a long signal appears when seven previous lows are strictly decreasing and the last completed candle makes a higher low with a close above the prior high. A short signal is generated by the mirrored condition on highs.
2. **Order execution** – once a signal is confirmed the strategy opens a market order with the volume calculated from account equity and the configured risk parameters.
3. **Trade management** – after entry a take-profit and trailing stop are set. The trailing stop activates only once the profit exceeds the trailing distance. If price reverses on the following candle (bearish for long, bullish for short) the position is closed immediately.
4. **Volume reduction** – consecutive losing trades reduce the traded volume according to the `Decrease Factor` parameter.

## Parameters

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TakeProfit` | Profit target in price steps from the entry price. |
| `TrailingStop` | Trailing stop distance in price steps. |
| `MaximumRisk` | Fraction of account value used to size the position. |
| `DecreaseFactor` | Reduces volume after consecutive losses. |
| `BaseVolume` | Fallback volume when portfolio value is unknown. |
| `CandleType` | Timeframe of candles to analyze. |

## Notes

The strategy processes only finished candles. No Python version is provided yet.
