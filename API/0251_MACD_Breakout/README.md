# MACD Breakout

The MACD Breakout strategy watches the MACD for sudden expansions. When readings jump beyond their normal range, price often starts a new move.

A position opens once the indicator pierces a band derived from recent data and a deviation multiplier. Long and short trades are possible with a stop attached.

This system fits momentum traders seeking early breakouts. Trades close as the MACD falls back toward the mean. Defaults start with `FastEmaPeriod` = 12.
