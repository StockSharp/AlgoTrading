# Directional Index K xDMI Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

This strategy uses the difference between +DI and -DI from the Average Directional Index to gauge trend direction. When the directional index rises above the key level the strategy buys, and when it falls below the negative key level it sells. Positions are closed when the absolute value of the index drops back under the threshold.
