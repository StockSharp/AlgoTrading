# Visible Chart Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

This sample shows how to work with a visible range of candles. The strategy tracks the highest high and lowest low over a configurable number of recent bars. A breakout above the visible high triggers a long entry, while a break below the visible low triggers a short entry.

## Details
- **Entry**: Breakout of the visible high/low.
- **Exit**: Opposite breakout.
- **Indicators**: Highest, Lowest.
