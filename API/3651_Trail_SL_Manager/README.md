# Trail SL Manager Strategy

## Summary

Trail SL Manager is a utility strategy that reproduces the behaviour of the original MetaTrader `trailSL` expert.
It does not open trades on its own. Instead, it supervises existing positions and dynamically adjusts their protective stop levels.
The logic mirrors the source script: first the stop is pushed to break even once price advances by a configurable amount, then an incremental trailing algorithm keeps locking profits as the trend continues.

## How it works

1. Subscribes to the configured candle stream to monitor finished bars.
2. Tracks the average entry price and direction of the current position.
3. When the price moves in favour of the trade by `BreakEvenTriggerPoints`, the stop is pushed to the entry price plus an optional offset.
4. After break-even activation, or immediately if allowed, the strategy increments the stop by `TrailOffsetPoints` every `TrailStepPoints` until price reverses and closes the position at market.

The trailing rules are calculated with the same point-based arithmetic as the MetaTrader version, so the behaviour stays familiar for traders migrating to StockSharp.

## Parameters

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `EnableBreakEven` | Enables moving the stop to break even once the trade becomes profitable. | `true` |
| `BreakEvenTriggerPoints` | Profit distance in points required to activate the break-even move. | `20` |
| `BreakEvenOffsetPoints` | Additional points added to the entry price when break even is executed. | `10` |
| `EnableTrailing` | Toggles the trailing stop logic. | `true` |
| `TrailAfterBreakEven` | If `true`, trailing starts only after the break-even adjustment. | `true` |
| `TrailStartPoints` | Minimum profit in points before trailing is allowed. | `40` |
| `TrailStepPoints` | Profit step between trailing recalculations. | `10` |
| `TrailOffsetPoints` | Points added to the stop on each trailing step. | `10` |
| `InitialStopPoints` | Distance of the initial protective stop when a new position appears. | `200` |
| `CandleType` | Candle subscription used to monitor price changes. | `1 Minute` |

## Usage

1. Attach the strategy to an environment where entries are generated by another strategy or manually.
2. Configure the point-based thresholds to match the symbol volatility and broker requirements.
3. Start the strategy so it can monitor finished candles and adjust stops automatically.
4. Monitor the chart drawings to see how the stop levels evolve with each trailing step.

> **Note:** The strategy closes positions with market orders when the simulated trailing stop is breached. Add exchange-specific protection (such as real stop orders) if required by your workflow.
