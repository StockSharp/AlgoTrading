[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

Collection of mathematical constants for use in strategies. It exposes values such as Euler's number, logarithms, geometric ratios and other special numbers so they can be referenced without manual declarations.

This module does not implement trading logic; it serves purely as a utility library.
