# Trade Entry Detector, Wick to Body Ratio Strategy

This strategy uses Bollinger Bands and the wick-to-body ratio of daily candles to detect entries. A long position is opened when a candle's lower wick is large enough and pierces the lower band. A short position is opened on the opposite condition. Positions are closed at the opposite band or when the swing level is broken.
