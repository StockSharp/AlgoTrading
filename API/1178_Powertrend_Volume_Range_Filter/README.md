# Powertrend - Volume Range Filter Strategy

This strategy uses a volume-adjusted range filter to define dynamic price bands. Long entries occur when price breaks the upper band during an uptrend, and positions close when price falls below the lower band. Optional filters include ADX, high/low trend confirmation, and a VWMA of the filter value.
