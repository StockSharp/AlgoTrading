# SMC BB Breakout Strategy

This strategy combines Bollinger Bands breakout with Smart Money Concepts swing shifts. A position is opened when price crosses the Bollinger Band in the direction of a market structure shift. Optionally, the entry requires a momentum candle with a large body. Positions are closed on a move back to the middle band or a breakout beyond recent order block levels.
