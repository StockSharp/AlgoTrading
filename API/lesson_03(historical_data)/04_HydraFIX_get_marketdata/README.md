# Detailed Explanation of Hydra FIX Connection for Market Data Retrieval

## Overview

This `MainWindow` class within a WPF application demonstrates how to establish a connection to Hydra via the FIX protocol to fetch market data, similarly to how one would connect to a conventional trading exchange. The code is structured to handle live candle data and display it in a chart format, offering functionalities to configure and save connection settings, and dynamically subscribe to different securities' data.

## Key Components and Functionalities

### Initialization and Configuration

The `MainWindow` constructor sets up the initial environment:

```csharp
public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    ConfigManager.RegisterService<IMessageAdapterProvider>(new InMemoryMessageAdapterProvider(_connector.Adapter.InnerAdapters));
    if (File.Exists(_connectorFile))
    {
        _connector.Load(_connectorFile.Deserialize<SettingsStorage>());
    }
    CandleSettingsEditor.DataType = DataType.TimeFrame(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));
    DatePickerBegin.SelectedDate = Paths.HistoryBeginDate;
    DatePickerEnd.SelectedDate = Paths.HistoryEndDate;
}
```
- **Connector Setup**: Initializes the `Connector`, which manages connections and data flow.
- **Configuration Loading**: Loads saved configurations if available.
- **UI Components Initialization**: Sets up data types and date pickers for the UI.

### Connection Establishment

Triggered by a button click, the method configures and initiates a connection to Hydra:

```csharp
private void Connect_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    SecurityPicker.SecurityProvider = _connector;
    SecurityPicker.MarketDataProvider = _connector;
    _connector.CandleProcessing += Connector_CandleSeriesProcessing;
    _connector.Connected += Connector_Connected;
    _connector.Connect();
}
```
- **Security Picker Configuration**: Designates the `Connector` as the source of security data and market data.
- **Event Subscriptions**: Hooks into the `CandleProcessing` and `Connected` events.
- **Connection Initiation**: Starts the connection process.

### Data Subscription and Processing

Upon successful connection, this section subscribes to candle data for a selected security:

```csharp
private void SecurityPicker_SecuritySelected(Security security)
{
    if (security == null) return;
    if (_subscription != null) _connector.UnSubscribe(_subscription);
    _subscription = new(CandleSettingsEditor.DataType.ToCandleSeries(security))
    {
        MarketData = { From = DatePickerBegin.SelectedDate, To = DatePickerEnd.SelectedDate, }
    };
    if (BuildFromTicks.IsChecked == true)
    {
        _subscription.MarketData.BuildMode = MarketDataBuildModes.Build;
        _subscription.MarketData.BuildFrom = DataType.Ticks;
    }
    Chart.ClearAreas();
    var area = new ChartArea();
    _candleElement = new ChartCandleElement();
    Chart.AddArea(area);
    Chart.AddElement(area, _candleElement, _subscription.CandleSeries);
    _connector.Subscribe(_subscription);
}
```
- **Subscription Management**: Unsubscribes from previous data streams and sets up a new subscription for the selected security.
- **Chart Setup**: Prepares the chart area and elements for data visualization.

### Candle Data Visualization

Handles the drawing of each candle on the chart as data is received:

```csharp
private void Connector_CandleSeriesProcessing(CandleSeries candleSeries, ICandleMessage candle)
{
    Chart.Draw(_candleElement, candle);
}
```
- **Real-Time Chart Update**: Updates the chart with new candle data as it arrives.

## Conclusion

This example efficiently demonstrates how to use the FIX protocol with the Hydra system to simulate an exchange-like connection for retrieving and visualizing live market data. The use of a WPF application allows for dynamic interaction with the data, such as selecting different securities and adjusting the data retrieval time frame. The system is designed to be modular and adaptable, suitable for real-time financial data processing and visualization.
