# Alligator + MA Trend Catcher Strategy

This strategy combines the Bill Williams Alligator with a 200-period EMA trend filter. A long position is opened when price is above the trendline and the Alligator lines (lips, teeth, jaw) are aligned upward. A short position is opened when price is below the trendline and the Alligator lines are aligned downward. Positions are closed when the opposite alignment occurs.
