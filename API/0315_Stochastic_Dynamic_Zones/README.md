# Stochastic Dynamic Zones

The **Stochastic Dynamic Zones** strategy is built around Stochastic Oscillator with Dynamic Overbought/Oversold Zones.

Signals trigger when Stochastic confirms trend changes on intraday (5m) data. This makes the method suitable for active traders.

Stops rely on ATR multiples and factors like StochPeriod, StochKPeriod. Adjust these defaults to balance risk and reward.
