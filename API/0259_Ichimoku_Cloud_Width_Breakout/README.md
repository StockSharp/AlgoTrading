# Ichimoku Cloud Width Breakout

The Ichimoku Cloud Width Breakout strategy watches the Ichimoku for sharp expansions. When readings jump beyond their average range, price often starts a new move.

A position opens once the indicator pierces a band derived from recent data and a deviation multiplier. Long and short trades are possible with a stop attached.

This system fits momentum traders seeking early breakouts. Trades close as the Ichimoku falls back toward the mean. Defaults start with `TenkanPeriod` = 9.
