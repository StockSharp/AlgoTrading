# IU Break of Any Session Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

The strategy records the high and low of a custom session and trades breakouts of that range during the trading window. A stop-loss is placed at the entry bar extreme and take profit uses a configurable risk to reward ratio. All positions are closed at the specified exit time.
