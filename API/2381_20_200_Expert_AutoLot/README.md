# 20/200 Expert AutoLot Strategy

This strategy opens at most one position per day at a user-defined hour. It compares the open price of two past bars (T1 and T2). If the earlier bar is higher than the later one by DeltaShort pips, it opens a short position. If the later bar is higher by DeltaLong pips, it opens a long position.

Position volume can be fixed or calculated automatically from account balance. When the balance decreases compared to the previous trade, the lot is multiplied by BigLotSize.

Each trade uses its own take-profit and stop-loss in pips. Additionally, a maximum holding time (MaxOpenTime) closes the trade after the specified number of hours.
