# RSI Slope Breakout

The RSI Slope Breakout strategy observes the rate of change of the RSI. An unusually steep slope hints that a new trend is forming.

Entries occur when slope exceeds its typical level by a multiple of standard deviation, taking trades in the direction of acceleration with a protective stop.

It appeals to active traders eager for early trend exposure. Positions exit when the slope drifts back toward normal readings. Default `RsiPeriod` = 14.
