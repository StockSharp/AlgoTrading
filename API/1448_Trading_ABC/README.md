# Trading ABC Strategy

This strategy approximates the Trading ABC concept using trend filters and a stochastic oscillator. A long trade is opened when price stays above several moving averages and the stochastic %K crosses above %D. A short trade is opened on the opposite conditions. Previous bar extremes act as protective stops.
