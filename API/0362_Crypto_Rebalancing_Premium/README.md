# Crypto Rebalancing Premium Strategy
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_cn.md)

The Crypto Rebalancing Premium strategy maintains an equal‑weight portfolio of Bitcoin and Ethereum. By rebalancing the basket each week it attempts to harvest the premium generated by volatility between the two assets.

The strategy watches hourly candles and performs a rebalance at the first hour of every Monday. Trades are skipped if the required adjustment is smaller than a user‑defined USD threshold.
