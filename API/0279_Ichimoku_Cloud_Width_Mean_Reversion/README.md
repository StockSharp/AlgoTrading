# Ichimoku Cloud Width Mean Reversion
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The Ichimoku Cloud Width Mean Reversion strategy focuses on extreme readings of the Ichimoku to exploit reversion. Wide departures from the normal level rarely last.

Trades trigger when the indicator swings far from its mean and then begins to reverse. Both long and short setups include a protective stop.

Suited for swing traders expecting oscillations, the strategy closes out once the Ichimoku returns toward balance. Starting parameter `TenkanPeriod` = 9.
