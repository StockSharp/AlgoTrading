# Volume Breakout
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The Volume Breakout strategy observes the Volume for rapid expansions. When readings jump beyond their average range, price often starts a new move.

A position opens once the indicator pierces a band derived from recent data and a deviation multiplier. Long and short trades are possible with a stop attached.

This system fits momentum traders seeking early breakouts. Trades close as the Volume falls back toward the mean. Defaults start with `AvgPeriod` = 20.
