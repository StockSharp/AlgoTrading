# Easy Robot Strategy

## Overview
Easy Robot is a momentum-following Expert Advisor that trades once per completed hourly candle. When the previous candle closes bullish the strategy opens a new long position; when it closes bearish it opens a short. Only one position can be active at any time, fully mirroring the original MetaTrader 4 logic.

## Trade Rules
1. Subscribe to the hourly candle type selected by the **CandleType** parameter (defaults to H1).
2. Once a candle is finished, compare its close with the open:
   - Close > Open: send a market buy order if no position is open.
   - Close < Open: send a market sell order if flat.
3. The position size uses the strategy `Volume` property, exactly like the MQL version that relied on `CheckVolumeValue` with a default of 0.01 lots.
4. Stop-loss and take-profit levels rely on an **Average True Range** indicator with period **AtrPeriod** (default 14):
   - Stop distance = `ATR * StopFactor`.
   - Take distance = `ATR * TakeFactor`.
   - Both distances are normalised by the minimal tick/pip distance so protective orders are never placed closer than the broker allows.
5. Protective orders are registered immediately after the market order through `SetStopLoss` and `SetTakeProfit`, providing the same behaviour as `OrderSend` with `sl` and `tp` parameters.
6. Optional trailing is activated when **UseTrailingStop** is true. After the trade accumulates **TrailingStartPips** profit (MetaTrader pips, i.e. points adjusted for 3/5 decimal quotes), the stop is moved closer by **TrailingStepPips** and is pushed further only when new profit extremes are reached. Trailing respects the brokerâ€™s minimal stop distance to avoid invalid modifications.
7. Quotes for stop calculations use the best bid/ask when available, falling back to the last price or candle close, matching the original `Bid`/`Ask` references.

## Parameters
| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `TakeFactor` | 4.2 | ATR multiplier for take-profit distance (maps to `TakeFactor` input in MQL). |
| `StopFactor` | 4.9 | ATR multiplier for stop-loss distance (maps to `StopFactor`). |
| `UseTrailingStop` | true | Enables MetaTrader-style trailing (`UseTstop`). |
| `TrailingStartPips` | 40 | Profit in pips before trailing can start (`Tstart`). |
| `TrailingStepPips` | 19 | Pip step applied when trailing updates (`Tstep`). |
| `AtrPeriod` | 14 | ATR calculation period for volatility sizing. |
| `CandleType` | H1 | Candle series used for signals and ATR input. |

## Notes
- The strategy resets stored entry and stop prices whenever the position returns to zero, ensuring a clean state for the next signal.
- Minimal stop distance is estimated via the instrument pip size (or price step when pip size is not available). This reproduces the `SC` helper from the MQL include file.
- `StartProtection()` is called once at start so the platform can manage emergency exits if needed.
