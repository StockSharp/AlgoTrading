# EMA Slope Mean Reversion

The EMA Slope Mean Reversion strategy focuses on extreme readings of the EMA to exploit reversion. Wide departures from the recent level rarely last.

Trades trigger when the indicator swings far from its mean and then begins to reverse. Both long and short setups include a protective stop.

Suited for swing traders expecting oscillations, the strategy closes out once the EMA returns toward balance. Starting parameter `EmaPeriod` = 20.
