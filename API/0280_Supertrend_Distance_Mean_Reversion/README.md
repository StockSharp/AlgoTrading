# Supertrend Distance Mean Reversion
[Русский](README_ru.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)
 
The Supertrend Distance Mean Reversion strategy focuses on extreme readings of the Supertrend to exploit reversion. Wide departures from the normal level rarely last.

Trades trigger when the indicator swings far from its mean and then begins to reverse. Both long and short setups include a protective stop.

Suited for swing traders expecting oscillations, the strategy closes out once the Supertrend returns toward balance. Starting parameter `AtrPeriod` = 10.
